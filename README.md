### An exploration of p5.js

## Abstract 
 - This project is meant to be an intro exploration into the use of p5.js. With a background in art and design I have a strong interest in the ability to integrate creative and fluid user interactions into web based applications. I also have a personal interest in using tools such as Processing and p5.js to create visual art. This project was a way to introduce and familiarize myself with p5.js and its potential to integrate into a React app. This app is meant to be a gallery displaying my various p5.js sketches. (Soon to add: descriptions of sketches and concepts/skills practiced in each - more interactive sketches that take user inputs and handle more generative focused visuals)
